## A HelloWorld Example

A web site is usually consist of several distinct functionalities. For example, you could have a web site with a message board, a blog, a forum and a news update. These functions are called "web apps" by Swiftly's notion. When implementing a web site with Swiftly, each web app is enclosed inside a single web app class. The web site can have several web app classes to provide all the functionalities. For one web app, you need to handle different paths. For example, you could have www.mysite.com/blog/page1, or www.mysite.com/blog/page2, these paths are handled by path handlers in Swiftly.

Knowing these basic ideas, implementing a HelloWorld web app is as simple as defining a web app class and registering a path handler.

First, let's define a web app class "HelloWorld":

```cpp
#include "WebApp.h"

class HelloWorld : public WebApp
{
    Q_OBJECT

    public:
        void registerPathHandlers();

    public slots:
        void handleHelloWorldGet(HttpRequest &,HttpResponse &);
};
```

This class has two functions to implement. One is a function called registerPathHandlers(). Swiftly calls this function to let the web app to register path handlers.

All you need to do here is calling addGetHandler, telling it for which path (in this case "/"), call which function to handle it (in this case "handleHelloWorldGet").

```cpp
void HelloWorld::registerPathHandlers()
{
    AddGetHandler("/", handleHelloWorldGet);
}
```

The second function is the actual path handler which does the actual work, i.e return "Hello World" to the user.

```cpp
void HelloWorld::handleHelloWorldGet(HttpRequest &request, HttpResponse &response)
{
    response << "hello world from Swiftly!\n";
}
```

That's it! Oh, don't forget writing a main function:

```cpp
#include <QCoreApplication>
#include <QThread>
#include "Swiftly.h"
#include "HelloWorld.h"

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    QCoreApplication a(argc, argv);
    REGISTER_WEBAPP(HelloWorld);
    HttpServer::getSingleton().start(QThread::idealThreadCount(), 8080);
    return a.exec();
}
```

The main function is also very simple. There are two things you need to do. First, call REGISTER_WEBAPP with the name of your web app class. This will tell Swiftly that we will need to run this web app. Second, call HttpServer::getSingleton().start(QThread::idealThreadCount(), 8080). This launches the web server on port 8080. So if you go to a web browser and type http://localhost:8080, you should be able to see "hello world from Swiftly!"
